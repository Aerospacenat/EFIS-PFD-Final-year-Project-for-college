# EFIS-PFD-Final-year-Project-for-college
The Electronic Flight Information System is the main system that integrates the PFD (Primary Flight Display) the EFIS also includes other instruments such as engine readings, fuel levels, flap and trim, and many other instruments. The PFD which is an artificial horizon is set on a blue and brown background the blue part which represents the sky is the top part and there is a middle between the two presenting the horizons, then the bottom part which is brown represents the ground. Also on the PFD is little segment of lines, the segment of lines means how fast you are ascending or descending in either feet or metres. For example, if you were taking off your rate of climb would be 20 feet or more. Also, the artificial horizon also roles of the plane therefore letting you know how steep your turn is a this the left or right. The EFIS must have the instruments that have been said by law, law means you must have the ASI which is the airspeed indicator, the altitude, the artificial horizon, roll and yaw, heading (which is like a compass) and of area which is for the rates of climb and descend.
